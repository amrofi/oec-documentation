# How to use this material?

This documentation is an attempt to try to explain how to use the scripts that generate the data that powers [The Atlas of Economic Complexity](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/). We made all the scripts available on [GitHub](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/).

It is important that you read from \@ref(data-sources) to \ref(product-space) before reading the coding part.
